# Wiki
This is the wiki repo for Pioneer Rocketry. *It's a work in progress. We've hardly started.*

This is everything we know about all of the little quirks our electronics have. This repository should be used to catalog everything that works and everything that doesn't. 

## How it works:

1. Everything that is a procedure is placed in the "Wiki" feature on GitHub. 

2. Any code or examples should be commited to the repository like any other code. 

3. The procedures will reference any example code or documents that are included in the repository.
